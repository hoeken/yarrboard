Firmware:
    * npm and signalk plugin release + document the process
    * reinvestigate firmware signing
    * investigate how to build multiple firmwares...  commandline pio?
    * protocol documentation
    * learn about building components for node-red, maybe make a yarrboard toolkit

8ch MOSFET:
    * remove CAN port - never going to use it.
    * change fan2 tach to pin 4
    * combine fan 1 pwm and fan 2 pwm to pin 16
    * add voltage detector to each channel for run detection - another mcp3208 + bus voltage divider circuit
    * maybe switch to "pcb welding terminal" connection like 74650073R or C5370858 or C3029538
        * or at least a 9.5mm pitch barrier terminal like C496131 or C430699 or C430687 or C707586
    * move to 4 layer design signal / gnd / gnd / signal

RGB Input:
    * move to 4 layer design signal / gnd / gnd / signal

Electronics:
    * update 3dp case for 8ch mosfet
    * design case for input board
    * design case for button board

Long Term Maybe?
    * Relay board - DC or AC?
    * Motor driver / H bridge?
